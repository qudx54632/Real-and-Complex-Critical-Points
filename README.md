# Real-and-Complex-Critical-Points

A Mathematica package for numerically computing real and complex critical points in 4-dimensional Lorentzian spinfoam amplitude.

This branch contains the Mathematica implementation developed for the paper “Mathematica program for numerically computing real and complex critical points in four-dimensional Lorentzian spinfoam amplitudes” (Phys. Rev. D 111, 024021, 2025). The code provides a complete, ready-to-use toolkit for constructing boundary data, solving for real and complex critical points, and evaluating the spinfoam action in both flat and curved geometries.

It is designed not only as a research tool but also as a practical handbook for graduate students who want to learn numerical spinfoam methods. The structure of the code follows the logical development in the paper, making it an ideal reference for self-study. By working through the examples, students can gain hands-on experience with:
	•	Constructing boundary data for various triangulations
	•	Computing real and complex critical points in Lorentzian EPRL models
	•	Comparing numerical results to the Regge action

This branch is a valuable complement to the published paper, offering a clear pathway from theoretical concepts to working numerical implementations.
