## Overview

This branch contains the Mathematica implementation developed for the paper:

> **"Mathematica program for numerically computing real and complex critical points in four-dimensional Lorentzian spinfoam amplitudes"**  
> *Phys. Rev. D 111, 024021 (2025)*  
> [DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.111.024021](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.024021)

The package provides a **complete, ready-to-use toolkit** for:
- Constructing boundary data
- Solving for real and complex critical points
- Evaluating the spinfoam action in both flat and curved geometries

## Educational Purpose

This repository is designed not only as a research tool, but also as a **practical handbook for graduate students** learning numerical spinfoam methods.  
The structure of the code mirrors the logical development in the paper, making it an ideal reference for self-study.

By following the included examples, students can gain hands-on experience in:

1. **Constructing boundary data** for various triangulations  
2. **Computing real and complex critical points** in Lorentzian EPRL models  
3. **Comparing numerical results** to the Regge action
